## StackOverflow_2017_survey_analysis

### Summary and Motivation
___
The purpose of this project is to use data collected by the Stack Overflow survey from 2017 to try and gain deeper insight into disproprotion of women in IT:

I would like to use this data to confirm the existance of the problem and see if there are any "hidden patterns" among the female population represented here (regarding the race, education or country of particants).

This project is part of the requirements for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, and a way to practice and demonstrate fundamental data science skills and the data science process.
